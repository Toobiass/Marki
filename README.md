# Marki

**Marki** is a modern, high-performance desktop application built with **Electron**, designed for users who value speed and aesthetic clarity.

## The Vision

The core philosophy behind Marki is to eliminate the friction between thought and digital ink. Most editors are cluttered or visually unappealing; Marki provides a distraction-free environment to jot down information instantly.

While fully mouse-compatible, the app is **keyboard-first**. Every essential action is mapped to intuitive shortcuts, allowing power users to navigate, edit, and manage their notes without ever lifting their hands from the home row.

* **Editor Only:** For deep-work writing sessions.
* **Preview Only:** For a clean reading experience.
* **Split View:** Real-time side-by-side synchronization for instant feedback.
